It was developed along with the UNIX operating system, and is strongly linked with UNIX operating system. History of C language revolves around development as a system implementation language to write an operating system.
In terms of the history of C language, its main features include low-level memory access as well as high-level memory access (so it is a  middle-level programming language), a handy set of keywords, and a neat and clean style, these features make C programming language suitable for system programming. C supports a wide variety of built-in functions, standard libraries and header files. It follows a top-down approach. Many languages have derived syntax directly or indirectly from the C programming language. For example, C++ is closely a superset of the C language. Also, C programming language is very popular for system-level apps.
To learn about the history of C language, let's first start with its root and early developments. The root of all modern languages is ALGOL (Algorithmic Language).</p>
